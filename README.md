# Artist Song Finder

Peyton Kringle

My project will be a web app that takes in an arists name and finds songs by that artist. It will save those results to a database to be accessed later, and will output the results organized on the screen.

## Web Service

I will be using the Spotify web service: (Spotify) [https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/] Using OAuth
